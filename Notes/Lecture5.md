## Switching Costs and Lock-In

- Switching from one product/service to another has a cost
	- e.g. learning new controls on a device
	- Some costs can be small, e.g. changing cars
	- Some digital costs can be high e.g. switching to completely new software
- For high switching costs, buyers are 'locked in' - guaranteed they'll continue using your products long term
	- Cost of changing is high compared with saving of switching to something cheaper

### Sources of switching costs

- Training users to use the system - costs time and money
- The network effect
	- If product is used by others the user interacts with then rival products won't have value - need to convince others to move
- Setup costs
	- Software has to be set up with new info etc.
- Reduced service quality due to loss of information
	- CRM info stored over time can improve the quality - e.g. media recommendations may not be as good on a new platform

## Digital Monopolies

- Where switching costs are high, less likely for rival to succeed so monopolies occur
- Where switching costs are lower, competition is easier

## Breaking into a network

- Proprietary formats - e.g. office .doc format
	- This was reverse engineering by OpenOffice - but momentum means Office is still ahead
- Standards
	- Opening up your network to competitors, but means you have a slice of a larger network
	- 'Network effect' of competitor's users gives value to your users

### Standard Leader

A standards leader opens up a proprietary format with the aim of increasing the size of the overall network of users

- e.g. PDF - format public early on
- PDF is now the market standard

How does Adobe make money?

- Exploit leadership position - make sure software is the best on the market
- Produce proprietary value-added products on this standard e.g. Adobe Distiller

### Standards War

Competing parties have too much invested in their formats so battle to dominate the market

- Usually not good for either sellers or buyers
- Tactics
	- Penetration pricing to build market share
	- Alliances with those selling complementry products
	- 'Expectations management' - customers want to buy the winner so declare victory early

### Standards Negotiation

- More common nowadays - players talk early
- Less commercial risk than a standards war
- Often still developing proprietary product while negotiating - as a bargaining chip

## Making Money in a 'Free' world

Near-zero variable costs of digital goods means price is driven to zero by competition

Different tactics to make money -

- Differentiate based on quality, and charge
	- e.g. Times - paywall in 2010
		- Readership - 3.1M -> 362,000 users
		- But made a profit compared to the previous year
	- e.g. Which - charge per month
		- Users trust so happy to pay - make money
- Capitalise on your brand
	- e.g. Guardian - ask people to voluntarily pay
- Sell complementary goods
	- Goods that increase value of each other
		- e.g. printers and ink
	- Digital good can be offered free, with a complementary good sold alongside e.g. free software with paid support
	- Can affiliate with provider of complementary good and share profits
- Advertise
	- More valuable when more is known about the recipient
	- e.g. 74% of Facebook ad US revenue came from local services

## Digital Advertising

- Digital channels will overtake traditional media by 2021
- Google and Faceboo have more than 50% of the share of the digital advertising market

### Online vs Offline Advertising

- Traditionally - charge based on where advert is and how many people will see it (e.g. billboard, magazine etc.)
- With online advertising there are more options
	- Cost per impression - charged whenever the ad is displayed
	- Cost per click - charged whenever the advert is clicked
	- Cost per lead - charged whenever a site passes an interested customer's details to the advertisers e.g. customer searches 'cheap car insurance'

Online advertising has a more sophisticated market for matching advertisers with advertising opportunities

- This is significantly automated e.g. Facebook/Google auctions
- Content providers devolve the selling of advertising space to specialist advertising platforms e.g. Google Adsense

### Google Adsense

- A service that allows content providers to specify areas of their site to be for advertising - Google then dynamically fills these
- Advert placement can be determined by page content and my explicitly entered info about the site
- Selection of adverts is determined by the Google Advert auction system - potential buyers bid for placement based on keyword and demographic information

### Social Networks and Adverts

- 'Earned' media is word of mouth e.g. anecdotes on websites
- 'Social advocacy' - we're more likely to buy things our friends have so Facebook will use this when advertising

### Search Advertising

- Varian estimated that a good click through rate is 3% of viewers
	- Of those 3% of clickers will actually make a purchase
	- 1/1000 is higher than that of traditional media e.g. TV ads
- Google runs the Google Ad Auction - a 'two-sided matching' mechanism 
	- Aims to match partners in a way maximise a value function
	- In this case - maximises the amount of money Google receives from click-throughs
	- Google wants to maximise $\text{(price per click)} * \text{(number of clicks)}$
