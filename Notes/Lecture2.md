# Lecture 2 - 2/10/18

## Intro

- Huge amount of wealth being made these days - more than every before
- Several of these success stories are due to the algorithmic innovations

## The Long Tail

> Book - The Long Tail, Chris Anderson (the WIRED article contains the important things)

### Background

Two ways to make money -

- High-volume, low-margin - selling lots of cheap things
- Low-volume, high-margin - selling a few expensive things

For margin $m$ and volume $v$ you can make $ $x$ via any $(m,v)$ that satisfies $mv=x$

For this reason, low-volume, low-margin tended to be a losing game

Internet lets you hold more "volume" than you could before

- Without a physical shop you don't have the cost of shelf space
- The internet allowed (effectively) almost infinite shelf space
- Businesses could now have low-volume, low-margin products

### The Concept

Turns out the biggest money may be in the smallest sales

Rules -

1. Make everything available - stock everything (even "unpopular" options)
2. Cut the price
3. "Help me find it" - make things easy to find

Many internet businesses use this concept -

- Amazon - makes a lot of money from long-tail products
- eBay - sells many niche one-off products
- Google - makes most of its money from small advertisers

### Amazon advantages

Amazon wasn't the first or only online bookstore (nor the biggest)

- Going online automates the *store*
- Going online automated *customer community-building*
	- Recommendations forces demand down the long tail
- Amazon also automated the key roles of the *bookseller*
	- Recommendations based on what you're buying

### Recommender Systems

- These are a type of Information Filtering (IF) technique that attempts to present item that are likely of interest to the user
- Typically compares the user's profile to some reference characteristics
- Could be based on user's content, or on the user's social environment
- They help users discover items they wouldn't find themselves - a good alternative to search algorithms

### Collaborative Filtering

- The process of filtering for information or patterns using techniques of collaboration among multiple agents
- Typically involve large data sets
- Applied to many different types of data - sensor data, financial data, ecommerce etc.
- Underlying assumption - those who agreed in the past tend to agree again in the future

### Criticism of the long tail

- Does the long-tail effect really exist?
- Some recent research brings it into question
	- The web actually magnifies the importance of blockbusters - is more money actually going to the tail?
	- It depends a lot on where the tail starts and end
	- etc.

Some research for it as well -

- Bynjolfsson, Hu, Smith - shows the long tail has grown longer over time - 36.7% of Amazon's sales
- Zhou, Duan - longer but fatter tail

## Disruptive Technology

> Book - The Innovator's Dilemma, Clayton Christensen

### Innovator's dilemma -

- Imagine company making money selling abstract device to customers
- Know customers well, and that you can improve your product forever
- Performance would just go up, and faster than the improvement required by the mainstream market

- You can see this playing out in the short term, but suddenly there's a new product which is worse than yours, but maybe better in another way
- You could ignore the other product, or analyse it a bit
	- You know their tech won't advance as fast as yours, so it's okay
	- But at some point customer needs will be met by the other technology which is cheaper (or something)

### Types of Innovations

- Sustaining innovations
	- Incrementl improvements on existing products/services
	- Attractive to existing customers, and existing business models
	- Eventually you offer more than what the customer wants
- Disruptive innovations
	- Perform less well than existing products
	- May be lower quality and less sophisticated
	- Simple, cheaper, more user-friendly

Disruptive innovations can cause strong companies to fail because they focus on higher-margin, higher-volume tech and leave the low-end of the market to others

*The Dilemma* - doing what made the company a success in the first place can lead it to failure


### Innovator's dilemma - step by step

Very often the disruptive technology is developed by the incumbent company

- IncumbentCo's existing customers are unimpressed
- IncumbentCo doesn't develop the disruptive tech, concentrats on sustaining innovations
- New companies form (sometimes from ex-employyes of IncumbentCo) and develop new markets for the technology
- As the disruptive tech matures it moves up the chain
- IncumbentCo realises there's a new market and attempts enter it, but it's late and fails

## Timeline

- Earlier companies were pipelines
	- e.g. replacing previous physical media pipelines, with digital-media pipelines
	- e.g. Google, Amazon, eBay
- Later companies were platform companies
	- e.g. Spotify, Snapchat, Airbnb

> Books -  The Sharing Economy, Matchmakers, The Platform Revolution

### The gig economy

- Not uncommon in many older industries (plumbing, music, taxi-drivers etc.)
- Platform business act as re-intermediators and aggregators
- Introduced a new issue - aggregators can ban people - informally acting as they're regulating the labour market but are private companies and not under legislation

## The future of work

- The internet/web lowers the cost of discovery and have low transport costs
- Multi-side matching platforms enable buyer/seller discovery
- At the moment both the buyer and seller are humans - but what is the seller is a machine and the resource is intelligence - AI!
