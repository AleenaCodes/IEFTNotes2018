# Lecture 16 - 27/11/18

## Intro

- What is financial technology? Can be thought of in 3 forms -
	- Digitisation of tech services
	- Fintech
	- Techfin
- Principles of success
	- LASIC - Low-margin, Asset-light, Scalable, Innovative, Compliance easy
- Examples of success
	- Transferwise, M-Pesa, AliPay
- FinTech/TechFin users
	- Future trends, by region
	- Impact on areas without a lot of access to finance
- Battle of TechFin Giants

## What is Finance?

- Based on money - a store of value to pay for goods and services
- Finance - all of things we can do with money
	- Payments - transacting money
	- Savings - storing money
	- Credit/Loans - borrowing money
	- Investments - asset purchase with the hope of generating income or appreciating in the future
	- Insurance - policies in which individual/entities receive financial protection against losses
	- Advice - planning, managing risks, investments

## Financial Regulation

- Import in determining what financial technologies can be developed and how well they may do
- Different between countries - has an impact on technologies
- Regulation is there to
	- Protect actors e.g. FSCS savings, deposit protection
	- Improve efficiencies e.g. monopoly regulation/antitrust laws
	- Reduce risk e.g. ring-fencing retail banking from other banking activities
- Financial regulation aims to build trust

## Financial Technology

- The intersection of finance and technology
- Been around for a long time e.g. barcodes, credit cards, ATMs

There are 3 key players -

- Traditional incumbent finance
	- Adding technology to streamline/automate their traditional business models e.g. mobile banking
	- This is a form of "incremental innovation"
	- Digitisation - incumbent finance adding digital technology to legacy service
- Tech start-ups
	- Identified a problem in financial technology and trying to solve it - disruptive technology
	- Disruptive innovation - looking at problem first, then developing technology to solve it
	- FinTech - Agile, start-up technology companies
- Incumbent "big techs"
	- e.g. Alibaba, Apple etc. - already have dominance in tech, want to make money from finance
	- Leverage positive network externalities and customer data
	- TechFin - giant, incumbent technology companies moving into finance

The "Digital Finance Cube" highlights key concepts from traditional service providers -

- Blockchain - distributed public ledgers
- Social networks - web-based services
- NFC - Near Field Communication
- P2P Technology - allowing transactions between individuals
- Big Data Analystics - analysing large volumes of data
- Further Enablers - mobile internet, developments in AI and machine learning

## Principles of Success - LASIC

Introduced in a paper in 2015

- Low-margin
- Asset-light
- Scalable
- Innovative
- Compliance easy

### Low profit margin

- In the internet age, services/info are expected to be free
	- Revenue is generated in other ways - advertising, pro versions etc.
	- Have to expect a low profit margin
- Lots of network effects so need to build critical mass before trying to monetise
- Ensure customer lock-in  - increase switching costs
- Profit margins will remain low so lots of users are necessary

### Asset light

- To enable a low profit margin must be asset light
- Be able to scale without incurring large fixed costs on asset
- "Free ride" on existing infrastructure can be the key
	- e.g. mobile phone networks, the internet etc.

### Scalability

- Technology must be scalable to reap the benefit from network externalities
- Ensure scale does not compromise efficiency or increase costs

### Innovative

- Products and operations must be innovative - preferably a compeletely new business model
- Widespread use of phones and the internet allows a lot of innovation in FinTech and TechFin

### Compliance easy

- Low regulatory compliance enables innovation
	- Depends on the region
	- Although there is a trade-off in terms of customer protections
- Business that receive incentives to aid inclusion have an advantage
- There is a first mover advantage - proven beneficial products may be allowed to proceed
- Different countries have different processes
	- e.g. China have "development-led regulation" vs India which have "development-lagged regulation"
	- Regulators will sit back for developer-led regulation and first see where the technology is going before putting down rules
- If identification remains an issue, scalability may be unattainable
	- e.g. low-touch solutions such as having to have a sim card
	- Preferable to not have to have a bank account/ID unless for complex functions
