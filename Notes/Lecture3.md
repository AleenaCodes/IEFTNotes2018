# Lecture 3 - 9/10/18

## Intro

- Lecturer - John Cartlidge
- Not employed by Thomson Reuters but sponsored by them
- This allows us some Thomson Reuter's data etc. that we can use

## Microeconomics

- Macroeconomics
	- Large-scale/general economic factors
	- e.g. interest rates, national productivity
	- Type of things governments are concerned with
	- *We're not really interested in this in this course*
- Microeconomics
	- Behaviour of individuals and firms in making decision regarding allocation of scarce resources
	- Interactions between individuals and firms
- Law of supply and demand
	- Determine price of a good or service

## Supply and Demand

### What is a fair price for a good?

- Could guess and reduce if too high
- Could look at it more theoretically - how do prices emerge in a market

### Demand

- Consumer's desire and willingness to pay for a specific good/service
	- Every individual has a price they're willing to pay
	- This will vary between people

### Market Demand

- Total of everybody's value that they're willing to pay
- We can plot aggregate quantity demanded
	- Price on y axis, quantity demand on x axis
	- This is because we think of price as a *function of quantity demanded*

Allows us to see what the demand of a market would be at a given price
- At £100 demand of 3
- At £400 demand of 0

When there are potential consumers in a market, the demand curve becomes smooth

- Demand curves tend to slope downwards - e.g. more people are willing to pay lower price
- Some things have different curves - e.g. with luxury goods more people may want it when it's more expensive

### Supply

- Supplier's willingness to sell at a given price
- Depends on things like production costs etc.

### Market Supply

- Total quantity of a good/service that is available to customers at a given price
- We can plot aggregate supply available
	- Price on y axis, quantity supply on x axis

- This becomes smooth with many suppliers

### Equilibrium Price

The point where demand and supply cross in the market is the market equlibirium

- N.B. We're only considering an idealisation here
- Prices tend towards an equilibrium if we consider the other cases

#### Excess Supply

- At price $P_1$ supply>demand - supply is in excess
- There is a product surplus
- $Q_2 - Q_1$ goods will be supplied but not purchased
- This will lead to prices falling from $P_1$
- This will eventually set to equilibrium price $P*$ where $\text{quantity supplied = quantity demanded}$

#### Excess Demand

- At price $P_1$ demand>supply - excess demand
- There is a product shortage
- $Q_2 - Q_1$ goods will be demanded but not supplied
- This will lead to prices rising from $P_1$
- This will eventually set to equilibrium price $P*$ where $\text{quantity supplied = quantity demanded}$

#### Market Shock

- A shift in demand affects price and quantity - the demand curve shifts
- Here is a negative shift from $D_1$ to $D_2$
- Equilibrium price falls to $P_2$ and equilibrium quantity falls to $Q_2$

Could be the result of technology disruption

### Utility/Profit

- Customers gain utility from the difference between what their prepared to pay and what they actually pay

## Internet Economics

- Digital good and the internet have substaintially changed the business landscape
- The economic laws still apply but we see new forces manifest - e.g. what happens when the price of production falls to almost 0

### Combinatorial Innovation

- The idea of technology surges
	- Things can be relatively stable, then suddenly an explosion in innovation
- Idea - sometimes the landscape is such that things combine together to result in rapid acceleration of innovation
- Initial success breeds more success

Example - standardisation of gears - used to be made bespoke, then producers could swap components for things they wanted to develop - allowed new innovations to grow on top of this as could 'plug and play' things

### Why is the 'internet revolution' so fast?

- Conbinatorial innnovation is not new - happened for manufacturing etc. before
- But this time it's a lot quicker
- Primarily - ease of access to innovators
	- Easier to reverse engineer - open source
	- Innovations are rapidly distributed globally
	- Cheap to get kit and train up

Varian - "open source software is the primordial soup for combinatorial innovation"

### Online Economic Activity

Different to traditional economics - digital goods vs. physical goods

Four different but interconnected activities -

- Digital goods - delivered online but used locally e.g. digital music, software
- Information goods - value is in the info it provides e.g. news site, stock exchange data feed
- Online purchasing of physical goods - e.g. buying physical things from Amazon
- Online provision of service - (not using locally) e.g. Spotify

Some overlap between these categories

###  Difference between physical and digital technology

- Digital goods are costly to produce but cheap to reproduce
	- Fixed cost - upfront, high
	- Variable cost - cost per sale, low
- Most of the production costs are sunk - e.g. can't be recovered (unliked selling off a factory)
- No capacity constraints limiting how many reproductions can be made
