## Recent Decentralised Ledgers

- 1st generation - Bitcoin - mainly based around transactions
	- But proof of work is inefficient, and is only really designed for keeping records
- 2nd generation - Ethereum - mainly around smart contracts/DApps
	- No longer just for currency - own programming language Solidity to make contracts in
	- Decentralised applications "DApps" create different tokens for each app
- 3rd generation - e.g. Cardano/ADA - mainly around smart contract/DApps but designed to be more efficient and secure

## Smart Contracts

- Smart contracts get rid of the need for an escrow - now the algorithm verifies everything before transferring money
- There are different types of DApps
	- Exchanging ether to settle a contract, 
	- Mixing money with other info (e.g. as insurance)
	- Decentralised autonomous organisations - a leaderless company 
		- The DAO structure includes investors holding tokens that allowed them to vote - a massive failure because of security and caused a fork from ETH to ETC

### Contracting Practice

- Smart contracts reduce things down to rules that have been followed
- In practice contracts often have clauses that are unenforcable by law
	- They are often used just to set social standards but not enforced in full details
	- Writing these sort of clauses produces a "chilling effect" - stops people from doing things that in reality couldn't be enforced anyway
- Contracts can also have vague terms - often on purpose
	- Aim to build a long-term relationship and hash out details later
- There can be willfull nonenforcement of terms
	- e.g. just threatening to take someone to court as opposed to doing it
	- The aim is to just have some leveraging power

Looking at these, we can see that smart contracts will only be useful for more simple "transactional" contracts

## Third Generation Blockchain

- Cardano
	- System designed from the ground-up - designed to take a few years to start up
	- Introduced proof of stake rather than proof of work

### Proof of Stake

- Proof of work essentially sets up a lottery to who'll win - complete luck
	- More attempts you make, the more likely you are to guess the nonce
	- This is costly - requires a lot of computing power
- Proof of stake works differently
	- Amount of stake you have is proportional to the likelihoodof finding the nonce

Cardano uses the Ouroborus framework, which uses multi-party computation to enforce proof-of-stake - it is the first provably secure proof-of-stake example
