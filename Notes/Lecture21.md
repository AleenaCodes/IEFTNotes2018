# Lecture 21 - 18/12/18

## Intro

- There used to be a division between who offers banking and insurance products
- Now the same company can offer both - there is more generalised 'financial services' these day
- There are two areas where tech is having a big effects
	- Insurance - InsureTech
		- Calculating and offering insurance
	- Regulation - RegTech
		- Specifically regulating of the financial services industry
		- Both enforcing regulations and spotting anomalous behaviour
		- Traditionally involved a lot of human labour, but is actually very amenable to automation

## InsurTech

Insurance has straightforward minimal mathematics -

- Some loss event $L$ that requires a payout $C$ as compensation
- $N$ customers all want to insure against $L$
- $P$ is expected number of payouts per year
- If all $N$ customers pay a premium $\frac{CP}{N}$ each year, all should be well in the long run
- As $N$ grows large - individual premium payments get smaller, estimates of $P$ get more accurate
- If total income exceeds payouts, surplus can be invested or returned
- A reserve fund is maintained to cover $> P$ payouts per year
- Insurers buy reinsurers to spread the risk of large payouts

### Example - "New Realities"

With the rise of VR/AR and mixed-reality - there are some new cases for insurance, and these are covered under InsureTech - KMPG estimates that these risks could cost businesses Â£20 billion annually

Risks include -

- Human risks
	- Physical risks - people becoming disoriented and injuring themselves
	- Mental risks - no long-term studies on what the effect of this will be - possible it may affects mental health
	- Digital consent - laws and liability are not defined in the "metaverse"
- Data risks
	- A range of data will be more susceptible to fraud and malicious acts e.g. biometric data, emotional data
	- Underlying legacy systems could be vulnerable to data and cyber breaches

It should be noted that a lot of this is conjecture - we don't yet know what the actual risk is

### Possible InsurTech Applications

- Claims - AR/MR headsets to conduct damage assessments
- Talent - help to attract new talent to the claims profession
- Underwriters - technology used to examine assets without needing to be onsite
- Brokers - help with analysing a client's risk profile
- Product developers - new insurance policies for new technologies
