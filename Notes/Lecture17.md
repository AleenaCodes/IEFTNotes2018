## Who Uses FinTech/TechFin?

- Tend to be young
- Tend to be wealthy
- More than 44% uptake in users earning more than $150,000 USD
- However note that these studies only look at developed countries - they don't reflect reality
- Traditional banking provides services for the world's most affluent - 
	- Almost 70% of the world's adult population are under-banked
	- The under-banked are poor - they need easy access (i.e. no long travel to branches)
	- They want a product they can trust
	- They need products that account for irregular incomes and no documentation
	- They have to be low-cost and easy to understand
- There are 3.5 billion custoemrs in the world who are underbanked - there is a lot of potential here to both help people and make money

Here we have venture capital investment plotted against formal banking penetration, with the bubble size showing the number of people in the area who don't have access to banking services

This can be split roughly into four regions -

- Top-left - "Bank Dominance"
	- Lots of banking penetration, little investment
	- Traditional banking sector is well-established
	- Hard for new players to penetrate the market - large bank dominance likely to continue
	- e.g. mbank in Poland launched mobile payments
- Top-right - "Partnering"
	- Lots of banking penetration, lots of investment
	- Banks well-entrenched and serve most of the system - can leverage tech to compete
	- Some FinTechs will scale, others will partner with banks
	- e.g. TransferWise is partnered with France's 2nd largest bank
- Bottom-right - "Tech Dominance"
	- Lots of investment, low banking penetration
	- Well-developed tech ecosystem with little banking, so large tech companies can move into this area
	- Some cross-sector convergence - tech companies obtain financial services licenses or partner with banks, while banks seek new functionality via partnership with FinTechs
	- e,g. AliPay dominates payments
- Bottom-left - "Race to the Finish"
	- Little investment, little banking penetration
	- Underdeveloped tech ecosystems
	- Hard for startups to begin when there's little investment but a lot of market for people who need banking
	- Telecom comapnies are the most significant local tech players - in some countries have led digitisation of finance through mobile money products
	- Banks can catch up if they innovate before telecoms corner the market
