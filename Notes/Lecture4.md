## Difference between physical and digital technology (cont.)

- Digital goods are often experience goods
	- Customers may not know their value without using them
- Positive network externalities are often very strong
	- "The network effect"
	- The value increases as other people also use it
- Searching costs are very low
	- Searching is easy and information is easy to come by

## Effect on competition

- If two companies are competing with identical, digital products, their variable costs are near-zero
- Competition will drive prices down to zero
- Risk that new companies won't be able to join the market
	- Very high upfront costs won't work with low possible profits
- For commodity digital goods, there will be a tendency towards monopoly/zero pricing
- Companies have to focus on product differentiation, or competing for emerging future monopolies

### Examples of (near) monopolies

- Payment - Paypal
- Search - Google
- Online marketplace - Amazon/eBay

### Disintermediation

- In the dotcom boom, it was predicted that small business would no longer need intermediaries to sell their products
- Predicted that the cost of reaching customers online would be dramatically less
- But as the cost of 'reaching' decreased, the cost of getting people's attention increased
- Instead a new kind of intermediary emerged - eBay, Amazon etc.
	- Allowed a single site to access and trade with many sellers
	- Trust is very important in an online marketplace - provided mechanisms to help assess trustworthiness

## Price Discrimination

- Idea - can we charge everyone the price that they're prepared to pay? - access additional profit
- Discriminating price based on buyers

Types of price discrimination - 

- 1st degree - personalising prices, difficult in physical world, easier online
- 2nd degree - offering different 'version' at different price points
- 3rd degree - offering different prices to different groups of customers e.g. student discounts, OAP discounts, charging more during business travel hours etc.

The reason it's possible online is because we can track what customer's do online and estimate how much they would be willing to pay

Price discrimination is legal as long as it's not on protected characteristics

### 1st degree

- Best way to maximise profits
- In a monopoly situation the seller wants to charge the maximum a customer will pay

### 2nd degree

- Offering different versions helps reveal and customer's willingness to pay
- Commonplace e.g. hardback first, then paperback
- Digital versions
	- Easier to prepare than physical versions - just offer 'cut down' versions
	- Near-zero cost to duplicate

There are many ways to do digital versioning -

- 'Try before you buy'
- Free versions with cut-down functionalities (e.g. games)
- Free versions with delay (e.g. stock feeds)
- Pay for no ads (e.g. Spotify)

These allow a customer to build a 'true valuation' of a product - people value something more when they have it than when they don't

Free versions also help build up the network effect

### 3rd degree

- Selling at different prices to different groups
- Used widely for physical products and services
	- Railcards
	- Peak fare during business hours
- Similar business models online
	- Student software license
	- Premium business versions

### Personalisation

- Versioning taken to the extreme - moves it to almost 1st degree price

### Bundling and Unbundling

- The selling of a number of products/services together for a single price
	- e.g. Microsoft Office, Google Apps for Business, music CDs
- Can be used to sell more to customers who would otherwise not purchase
- Reduces 'dispersion of willingness to pay' i.e. makes the demand curver flatter
- Bundling is cheap to perform for digital goods
- Because no physical substrate is needed, there is less commercial pressure to bundle - newspapers, CDs can unbundle
- Can reduce profit overall but introduce competition for parts of the bundle

## Economics of 'The Network Effect'

If two parties trade and it has an effect on others who had no say in the trade - it is an *externality*

- A *negative externality* imposes cost on others - e.g. pollution from a car
- A *positive externality* provides benefit to others - e.g. fire alarm for your home will provide safety to the surrounding houses
	- Examples - Microsoft Office made file format very accessible, social networks doesn't have value without other people

A *network externality* occurs when the act of buying a product/service confers an indirect cost or value on those who already have the product/service - e.g. buying a car can mean more petrol stations for other drivers, or make the road more congested for other drivers

- Can see that initially valuation is low, and grows faster once more people use something
- *Penetration pricing* - is needed where early adopters are charged less (or even free) to build the network
	- e.g. Adobe gave everyone ability to use PDF format and profit by charging for software to make and edit them
	- "Freemium" pricing gets people using things, after which people will be more willing to pay
