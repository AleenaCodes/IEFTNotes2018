# Lecture 13 - 13/11/18

## Intro

- Gaming is a massive industry - sales of video games, e-gaming etc.

## MMO Glossary

- MUD - Multi-User Dungeon
- Botting - using bots to play the game - may want to temporarily leave the game but continue playing
- Nerfing - reducing power of an item/ability to balance the game or stop gold farming etc.
- Newbie (noob) - a new (inexperienced) player
- Twinking - an experienced players helping a newbie, often by giving them in-game resources
- Crafting - skills that allows players to manufacture objects from raw resources
- Buffing - casting a spell on friendly characters to give them an in-game advantage
- Ninja - stealing 'loot' from a killed monster before the group has decided on a fair allocation
- Spawn camping - waiting at a location for a rare monster or resource to re-spawn
- Grinding - doing a repetitive in-game task to gain in-game resources
- Shard - one or more servers that make up a shared game world
	- Can be costly to host big servers so game can break into islands etc. - limit players in each
- PvE - Player vs Environment - combat between players and NPCs
- PvP - Player vs Player - human-controlled players may attack each other
- BoE - Bind on Equip - once a player has used a BoE item it cannot be used or sold to another player
- BoP - Bind on Pickup - once a player has picked up a BoP item it cannot be used or sold to another player
- MUUL (MUA) - Monthly Unique User Logins (Monthly Active Users) - the amount of active players/subscribers
- PCU - Peak Concurrent Users - the highest number of players online at the same time

## World of Warcraft vs. Real Life

- World of Warcraft is a MMORPG where large numbers of players (> 500) can interact in a shared online world
- After 8 years it had 8 million active subscribers and over 50% of MMORPG subscribers (data stopped being available in 2012 but it probably similar now)
- The impact is more than just the number of players - it is now part of pop culture, and there have even been some studies on its socioeconomic impact

<br> <br>

- The game has a whole load of game economics
- Different servers have identical starting conditions but different economics (e.g. PvP and PvE)
- In-game economies ofen have the same issues as real economics (but without tax!)
- For a stable economy, there needs to be a balance between currency sources and sinks
	- Otherwise this will lead to "MUDflation"
- High-end players create their own metagame currencies e.g. Dragon Kill Points (DKP)
- Virtual crime is also a problem in some PvP game e.g. stealing pets, resources etc.

## "Real" Game Economics

- In early games they hadn't thought of selling things outside the game - so was easy to just put things on a USB and sell
- Castanova did analysis in 2001 of *Everquest* (EQ) on the exchange rate between EQ Gold and US dollars
- In a country where the GDP is less than that of the game, it becomes viable to stop local economy and make money from the game - *Gold farming* (using grinding etc.)
	- In Mexico, Bulgaria, Eastern Europe etc.

### Gold Farming

This led to 'gold farming' - at it's peak over 500,000 people worked in this industry worldwide

- People felt that it was fair to pay someone to progress quicker in the game as they'd be working somewhere horrible if they weren't gold farming
- But in reality gold farming workers didn't have good working conditions and had many health issues
- Games tried to stop this with their EULA - didn't allow players to have others login
- Like any industry, Gold farming is becoming increasingly automated

What do Gold Farmers do?

- Sell in-game currency
- Selling in-game items
	- Game studios have introduced BoE and BoP items to try to prevent this
- Power-levelling
	- Users pay to have someone else play that game for them and generate progress

Gold farming shows classic capitalist development

- Subsistence -> Barter -> Monestisation
- Wage Labour -> Globalisation/Offshoring -> Automation

This is a replay of the industrial revolution

Games companies  have started fighting back

- Game-company strategy has gone from 'ignore it' to 'fight it'
- Other strategies include 'permit it', 'host it' or 'become it'
- There are threats to gold farming - reporting, banning, disrupting, nerfing, patches, abuse, attacks, devaluation

## Online AI and the Turing Test

- WoW allows for macros, scripting and programmable UI, but there are issues - what's the different between a 'helper' and a full-on AI
- Bots are illegal but increasingly common
- Requires a large-scale Turing Test to work out who is human and who is a bot
- AI bots are common in many other games e.g. online Poker

## Game Development

- Game development costs have grown a huge amount in recent years - the costs are crippling the industry
- Developers are looking at other ways to do things -
	- User-created content - e.g. Little Big Planet
	- User-created virtual communities
- It's hard to get data on this - companies closely guard numbers for competitive and tax evading purposes - for large games budgets are many 100's of millions
	- However the average game budget has gone down as the average game is made by 10-15 people - these games usually fail
	- Mid-size (50-75) game studios have all but disappeared - either absorbed by gorilla companies or fragmented into mobile/casual/f2p
- This shift is caused by two things - growth of content cost, marketing costs

Content costs -

- Total labour costs have gone up vastly - now takes 10x hours to make each part of a game
- Game devs are tired of being small cogs in big studios and leave to make indie games
- Rising costs are useful for big studios - now can't have small entrants to the market
